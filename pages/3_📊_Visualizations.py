***Gender***
* The trend shows a relatively balanced performance for both genders across the departments. It should however be noted only two departments (Data Science and Development) had the average performance for both genders at 3(excellent) and above. The company should therefore focus on empowering both male and females with perfoance enhancement trainings and investigate possible gender based recruitment process that may be taking place silently in the deparments
            
***Education Background***
* Different education backgrounds performed diffrently across the different departments. The company should therefore seek to recruit employees in the departments based on the outstanding performing education background per department.
            
***Marital Status***            
* It can be noted that different marital statuses perform differently across the diffrent departments. There is no unique trend across the departmsnts. The company should therefore recruit employees depending on the outstanding performance in a pasticular department. For example, married employees in the Data Science department had the best average (above 3.5) hence the talent acquisition team should always consider married employees in that department
            
***Business Travel Frequency***
* As seen from the visualization travel frequency affected the perfomance differently and there was no linear correlation across all departments. The company should therefore balance all the departments with frequncy needed to avoid misuse of funds injected into business travels that do not yield a positive performance.
            
***Overtime***
* There is no linear correlation as well. It seems overtime affected some departments positively and otheres negatively. The company should therefore seek to a common overtime rate across all departments. The company needs to allow overtime on departments that are positively impacted

***Education Background***                                                           
* The chart shows different trends again across the departments. The company needs to balance the sizes of their departments according to their needs to maximize the performance per department

##### Departmentwise performance rating average per cohort
* Different ages performed differently in different departments. For example the 25-34 age group performed outstandingly in the Data Science compared to all other departments. The age between 15-24 performed well in Development. The age 55+ performed poorly in Finance. The company needs to structure its departments with the correct employee age groups
* Distance is also affecting the perfomance differently. This could be because of the nature of work done by the employees.The company needs to advise their employees on living within the distance that does not incovenience their acess to work
* The hourly rate also has different effects on dirrent departments. The hourly rate of 60-74 seem to have a better balance across all the departments. The company therefore needs to compensate their employees fairly to cultivate a positive mindset among towards better performances
* The salary hike percentage is clearly affecting the employee performance across all the departments. Employees with a salary hike of 20+ percent performed better than all other employees with a lower hike. The issue of undercompensation should be investigated in this company. The company therefore needs to have a standard salary hike percentage that is applied to all employees
* Employees in each department are affected differently according to their work experience. Therefore, it is recommended that each department recruits employees with with the work experience that produces an outstanding performance
* Work Experience in this company shows that employees with 0-9 years experience in the company have a balanced performance. Employees with an experience between 20-29 years in this company had a weak performance across all the departments. It should also be noted that employees with 30+ years experience in the company performed well in Research & Development. The company should therefore address the employee overstay issue in different departments. 
* Research and Sales departments prove a linear relationship between the performance and the 12+ years experience in the roles they are holding. Other departments different results across. Therefore, there are departments whose employees depict job monotony and others are comfortable. The company needs to structure every job role with the time limit the employee can hold the position
* Years since last promotion does not show a clear picture on the performance rating. It keeps changing in every department. Hence the company has to structure the promotion timeline per department
* Data Science, Development and Finance departments clearly indicate that staying with the same manager longer affected their performance negatively. The company should consider constant managr rotation in these departments. On the other hand, Human Resources and Sales departments indicates that the longer an employee stays with the manager the better the performance. Therefore manager rotation should be minimized.

The Bachelor level performeed better than the other because they are in a transition stage to better their careers while below College might have performed poorly because of the lower compensation. Doctor level would have been expected to perfom better but it did not in this case and this could mean such employees are more focused on other projects than work.
* It is therefore recommended that the company focus on hiring Bachelor, College and Masters employees who are more focused to performing better at work. This would in return reduce the escalations and improve the company's Net Promoter Score
